> ## Introduction

The user for this browser based weather dashboard application, will want to see a weather outlook for multiple cities: the user will submit these cities using a form input on the webpage and these will need to be saved to local storage so that they remain persistent even when the user refreshes the browser.

When the user searches for a city, the user will be presented with the current weather and future five day weather forecast - starting from the current day, thus; the current day will need to change to the specific day the user opens the weather dashboard application.

> ## Acceptance Criteria

Present the user with the following weather related information:

- The name of the city, the user has searched for.
- The current date
- An icon representation of the weather conditions for the current day and future five day forecast.
- The temperature
- The humidity
- The wind speed

The user can control the different weather forecast presented by clicking on the search history buttons situated on the aside container of the web application and each button will indicate to the user which city has been searched for previously.

For collecting weather information, this weather dashboard application will be using a free and opensource API named **[OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/)**.
